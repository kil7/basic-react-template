# Basic Template for React Stuff

Because CRA is total shite and Vite is magic and magic is scary.

## Things to Change
1. Name in package.json
2. Title in HTML template.
3. Webpack optimizations stuff in webpack config. I don't really know what I'm doing there.

## Usage
`npx degit kil7/basic-react-template call-it-whatever`
